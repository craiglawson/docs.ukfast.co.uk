If you navigate to your ‘Personal Folders’ you will see the following screen. Of course, if you already have some files here, they will be listed.

In order to create a folder, you want to choose ‘Create Folder’. Once you have done this, the following screen will appear. This requires you to enter the name of the folder and you can also add a description if you like. You also have the option to add people to the folder right away or you can do this after the folder has been created.

You can add a user to the folder by entering their name if they are already in the address book, or by creating a new user. On the right, you can adjust the folder permissions to what you deem necessary. Take note that you can’t assign different permissions to different users in this view.

Once users have been added, you can see their permissions by clicking ‘People on this Folder’.
